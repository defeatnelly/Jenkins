Continuous integration is the practice of automatically building and unit testing an entire application frequently, ideally on every source code check-inâ€” dozens of times a day if necessary.
Continuous delivery is the additional practice of deploying every change to a production-like environment and performing automated integration and acceptance testing after it passes its build and unit tests.
Continuous deployment extends this concept to where every change goes through full automated testing and is deployed automatically to the production environment.
